# Sales Data Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes sales data to uncover trends, visualize revenue distribution, and build a predictive model for revenue forecasting. The dataset contains sales-related information such as revenue, unit cost, unit price, and cost across various products and countries. This is a data analysis project that examines sales data to uncover insights, trends, and potential predictive models. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning modeling.

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to:
- Identify key sales trends.
- Understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future sales.

## üìä Key Insights
- Seasonal trends significantly impact sales performance.
- High correlation exists between promotional discounts and increased sales volume.
- Machine learning models provide reliable forecasts for future sales based on historical data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
The following Python libraries and tools are used in this project:
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and documentation
- SQL for data cleaning

## Files in Repository
- super sales project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis and model training
- cleaned_sales_data.csv: Processed dataset after cleaning
- sales data.xlsx: cleaned dataset with SQL
- salesforcourse-4fe2kehu.xlsx: Original Dataset

## Dataset
- The dataset is a raw Excel file named **salesforcourse-4fe2kehu.xlsx**
- The SQl cleaned Excel file named **sales data.xlsx**
- The analysis focuses on the cleaned sheet: **cleaned sales file**.

## Project Workflow
#### 1. Data Loading
- The dataset is loaded from an Excel file using pandas.read_excel().
- Initial exploration includes checking descriptive statistics and missing values.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics are computed.
- Missing values are analyzed and handled.
- Visualizations include:
  - Histograms and bar charts for sales distribution.
  - Scatter plots for correlations.
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
  - Line plots to analyze trends over time.

#### 3. Data Preprocessing
-Handling missing values.
-Encoding categorical variables.
-Feature engineering for better model performance.

#### 4. Machine Learning Model

- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
- A predictive model is trained using:
  -Linear Regression
  -Decision Trees
  -Random Forest
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE.

#### 5. Results & Insights
- Key trends and patterns in sales data are highlighted.
- Model performance is compared across different algorithms.
- Business insights and recommendations are provided.

## How to Use
- Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries.
-Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.
-Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step to reproduce the analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate deep learning models.
- Improve feature selection and engineering.
- Automate report generation with interactive dashboards.
