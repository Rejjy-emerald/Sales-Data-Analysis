# Sales Data Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes sales data to uncover trends, visualize revenue distribution, and build a predictive model for revenue forecasting. The dataset contains sales-related information such as revenue, unit cost, unit price, and cost across various products and countries.

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to:
- Identify key sales trends.
- Understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future sales.

## üìä Key Insights
- **Revenue Trends:** Identified periods of high sales revenue across different countries.
- **Product Performance:** Determined top-selling products and their contribution to total revenue.
- **Cost vs. Revenue Relationship:** Analyzed the impact of unit cost and price on revenue generation.
- **Predictive Model Performance:** Achieved an RMSE of 36.41, demonstrating the model's ability to predict revenue.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, SQL for data cleaning, Power BI for dashboard visualizations

## Files in Repository
- super sales project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis and model training
- cleaned_sales_data.csv: Processed dataset after cleaning
- sales data.xlsx: cleaned dataset with SQL
- salesforcourse-4fe2kehu.xlsx: Original Dataset

## üîç Dataset
- **Source:** Provided sales data (Excel format)
- **Key Columns:**
  - Date: Sales date
  - Country: Country where the sale occurred
  - Product Category: Category of the product sold
  - Revenue: Total revenue generated
  - Unit Cost: Cost per unit
  - Unit Price: Selling price per unit
  - Cost: Total cost

## üìä Analysis & Visualizations
#### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
 Converted Date column to datetime format.
- Removed outliers based on the 95th percentile.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Revenue Trends**: Visualized sales revenue over time.
- **Revenue Distribution**: Histogram of revenue.
- **Revenue by Country**: Bar chart showing total revenue by country.
- **Revenue by Product Category**: Pie chart representation.
- **Top-Selling Products**: Bar chart for the highest revenue-generating products.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap to identify relationships between numerical variables.

#### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **Model Used**: Ridge Regression with Polynomial Features.
- **Feature Selection**: Unit Cost, Unit Price, Cost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search applied to optimize polynomial degree and Ridge alpha value.
- **Model Evaluation:**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average prediction error.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures variance of prediction errors.
   - **R2 Score**: Evaluates model performance.
- **Final RMSE on Test Set: 36.41.**
